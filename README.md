## Automated ELK Stack Deployment

The files in this repository were used to configure the network depicted below.

These files have been tested and used to generate a live ELK deployment on Azure. They can be used to either recreate the entire deployment pictured above or, alternatively, select portions of the Elk file may be used to install only certain pieces of it, such as Filebeat.

### Description of the Topology

The main purpose of this network is to expose a load-balanced and monitored instance of DVWA, the D*mn Vulnerable Web Application.

Load balancing ensures that the application will be highly effective, in addition to restricting access to the network.

What aspect of security do load balancers protect? 

They protect the information going into the various end points, so the network remains available and doesn’t let one server get overwhelmed. 

What is the advantage of a jump box? 

The Jump box gives you the ability to create, deploy, scale and secure access to a virtual network.

Also integrating an ELK server allows users to easily monitor the vulnerable VMs for changes to the logs and systems applications.



What does Filebeat watch for? 

It watches and tracks changes in the file system.

What does Metric Beat record?

Metric Beat records machine metrics, such as uptime and cpu usage.
The configuration details of each machine may be found below.

Name	Function	IP Address	Operating System
Jump Box	Gateway	10.0.0.4	Linux
Web – 1	Server	10.0.0.5	Linux
Web -2	Server	10.0.0.6	Linux
Elk Virtual Machine	Server	10.1.0.4	Linux


### Access Policies

The machines on the internal network are not exposed to the public Internet. 

Only the jump box machine can accept connections from the Internet. Access to this machine is only allowed from the following IP addresses:

The access allowed is from my private IP address of 10.0.0.4. Note, this is converted by my router to a public ip and is allowed access via ssh. The access granted is from the Allow SSH network security rule via port 22. Also via the ansible container I can access the Elk VM at 10.1.0.4.

Machines within the network can only be accessed by ssh’ing via the ansible container installed by Docker.io on the jump box provisioner.

Which machine did you allow to access your ELK VM?

My personal machine first gains access to the jump box, then via the ansible container installed it can use a new ssh key to connect to the Elk VM. 
The Elk VM IP is 10.1.0.4

A summary of the access policies in place can be found in the table below.

Name	Publicly Accessible	Allowed IP Addresses
Jump Box	Yes	10.0.0.4    10.1.0.4

 

### Elk Configuration

Ansible was used to automate configuration of the ELK machine. No configuration was performed manually, which is advantageous because it’s easy to scale or destroy and is cheaper in a virtual environment.

The playbook implements the following tasks:

1. Set the vm.max_map_count to 262144
This configures the target VM to use more memory and the elk container will not run without this setting.

2. Install apt packages docker.io
These packages are needed to install the Docker container sebp/elk:761
 
3. Install the python3-pip package.
This package is needed to control the container with software 


The following screenshot displays the result of running `sudo docker ps` after successfully configuring the ELK instance.

### Target Machines & Beats

This ELK server is configured to monitor the following machines:
List the IP addresses of the machines you are monitoring

The 2 web servers in the US region are being monitored by the Elk server. 
Their private IP addresses are 10.0.0.5 and 10.0.0.6.

What Beats have been installed on these machines?
Filebeat and Metricbeat were successfully installed. These beats are often used to collect log files and other data from specific files, such as those generated by Apache, Microsoft Azure tools, the Nginx web server, and MySQL databases. Examples include system logs, source IP and destinations, Geocoordinates of source traffic which can all be analyzed for problem solving.

### Using the Playbook
In order to use the playbook, you will need to have an Ansible control node already configured. Assuming you have such a control node provisioned: 

SSH into the control node and follow the steps below:
- Copy the playbook file to the right directory.
- Update the hosts file to include the right IP address and group addition
- Run the playbook, and navigate to the Elk VM to check that the installation worked as expected.

Which file is the playbook? 
install-elk.yml

Where do you copy it?
To your ansible container.

Which file do you update to make Ansible run the playbook on a specific machine? 
The Hosts file.

How do I specify which machine to install the ELK server on versus which to install Filebeat on? 

By starting from the Jump box ansible container, then adding the Elk group to the hosts file, then executing the install-elk.yml playbook. That will install the Elk server to the Elk VM. Then once the ELK container on the ELK VM is up you can run a additional playbook(s) for filebeat and metricbeat from the files and roles folders and it installs to that Elk VM container machine(s) only.

Which URL do you navigate to check that the ELK server is running?
http://[ELK SERVER IP]:5601/app/kibana
